    Explain the principle of carding in a flat carding machine.
âž¤ Include a schematic diagram showing fibre passage and rotation directions.
Compare stationary flat card and roller clearer card.
âž¤ Mention the types of fibres processed in each and objectives of parts involved.
Discuss the effect of carding settings on performance:
âž¤ Cylinder to taker-in, Mote knife to taker-in, Flat to cylinder, Doffer to cylinder.
What is the role of worker and stripper rollers in the breaker card?
âž¤ Add a neat diagram and explain combined action.
Write short notes on the following (choose any four):
Flat stripping comb
Flexible bends
Licker-in under casing
Flat comb
Actual vs mechanical draft
Explain differences between jute and cotton carding.
âž¤ Why does the nature of carding differ?
ðŸ”¹ Group B â€“ Drawing Process & Screw Gill Machines
What is the purpose of drafting and doubling in the draw frame process?
âž¤ Also define and explain floating fibres and spewing.
Discuss the construction and working of a Screw Gill Drawing Machine.
âž¤ Focus on: Faller bars, pitch, lead, nip, reach, and check levers.
Why is jute drawing done in multiple stages?
âž¤ Explain with the impact on yarn quality and sliver regularity.
Role of the doubling plate in drawing.
âž¤ How do you adjust it when using three drawing machines?
Calculate:
âž¤ Sliver weight and draft at each stage from spreader to finisher given MR and lbs/spy.
âž¤ OR, production from given doffer rpm, efficiency, and hank.
Write short notes on (any three):
Faller screw
Check lever
DCP (Draft Change Pinion)
Rotary vs Mackhigh Drawing Frame
ðŸ”¹ Bonus Predictable Theory/Numerical Topics
Objectives and control of Breaker and Finisher cards
Influence of static electricity and drafting waves
Waste % calculation at various carding points (Licker-in, Cylinder, Flats, etc.)
Cotton Draw Frame drafting systems and roller weighting theory
âœ… Tips to Prioritize for Study:
Draw diagrams: Carding region, Screw gill parts, Feed systems, Drafting zones.
Master terms and calculations: Draft, lead, pitch, efficiency, DCP.
Understand physical processes: Carding, drawing, doubling â€“ both theory and practical effects.
Revise comparisons: Jute vs Cotton carding and drawing.
